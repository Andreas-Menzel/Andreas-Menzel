# Hello and Welcome to my Github Profile 👨‍💻

`Hello World!` 👋 My name is Andreas Menzel. I'm a Software Engineer specializing in Python. When I'm not writing code, I like ~crashing~ flying fpv drones.

I'm always up for exciting collaborations on private and commercial projects. If you have a brilliant idea or need some coding wizardry, feel free to reach out! Let's join forces and create something fun and extraordinary together.

## My Favorite Project ❤️

My most beloved project (so far) has to be the fully functional Proof-of-Concept *Autonomous Drone Delivery System* (ADDS) that I brought to life as part of my Bachelor's Thesis at the Technical University of Munich.

🚁 The goal of ADDS was to automate the coordination and control of multiple drones simultaneously, ensuring the safe and autonomous transport of small cargo containers.

The ADDS comprises four essential components, three of which are publicly available and open source:
- [ADDS-FlightControl](https://github.com/Andreas-Menzel/ADDS-FlightControl): This repository hosts the central server and brain of ADDS. It plans flight routes for each drone, ensuring collision avoidance. It also interfaces with the blockchain and manages the blackbox for secure data storage.
- [ADDS-DJI-AndroidApp](https://github.com/Andreas-Menzel/ADDS-DJI-AndroidApp): This repository houses an Android App that serves as the bridge between hardware and software, by sending the commands from Flight Control to the drone and requesting flight data to send back to Flight Control.
- [ADDS-ControlPanel](https://github.com/Andreas-Menzel/ADDS-ControlPanel): In this repository, you'll find the web application that enables monitoring of the entire drone fleet. It offers multiple interactive "applets," including an interactive OpenStreetMap view and bar charts to monitor the state of charge of each drone, among other features.

Please note that the code for the fourth component, *ADDS-CChainLink*, is kept private as it incorporates a blockchain technology developed by my professor, which is not yet publicly available. ADDS-CChainLink ensures the secure storage of flight data in a blockchain, preventing manipulation or deletion.

**For more detailed information, feel free to explore the READMEs of each repository. Happy exploring! 🥳**

<!--
- 🎓 I'm currently in the last quarter of my final university project AutonomousDroneDeliverySystem for my Bachelor Thesis at Technical University Munich. The repositories are private for now, but will all be published once the thesis is written :)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Autonomous Drone Delivery System, which consists of the following tasks / programming languages:
    - Python + Flask + SQLite: Backend API services for multiple components
        - Implementation of a blackbox system for drones
        - Crash-avoiding path planning for a fleet of multiple drones
        - ...
    - HTML + CSS + JS: Webapplication
        - Monitor the drones (plural) data in real-time
        - Interact with the drone fleet
        - ...
    - Android Studio + Java: Implementation of a DJI App
        - Android App to interface with DJI drones
        - Fetching commands from Flight Control, uploading missions to the drone
        - ...
    - GO (just a little): Interface with a blockchain to save the blackbox data
    - Ansible: Setup the server(s)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android App Development + Java + DJI MSDK, Python and some things about electronics (drone hardware- & software setup)

# Bored? 😶‍🌫️
Lucky you! I have two tasks you can master 🥳

## Fix bugs in one of my projects

Choose a repository you like or find interesting. Check out the code and improve it: remove bugs, increase performance, etc.

You may want to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/andreas-menzel/taskscheduler">TaskScheduler</a>. It still misses some tests. 😧

## Find the hidden cookie

I have hidden a <sub>secret</sub> <sup>cookie</sup> somewhere in my profile. If you can find it, you can eat it.
